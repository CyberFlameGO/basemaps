# Contributing to Basemaps

We would love for you to contribute to basemaps and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:


## Commit message

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
